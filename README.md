**Altus** is an Electron-based WhatsApp client with themes and multiple account support, available for Windows, Mac and Linux!

## Features

**Altus** uses the GitHub-produced Electron framework to wrap around WhatsApp Web and add extra features to it.

- **Multiple Account Support**: As of v2.0, you can use multiple WhatsApp accounts simultaneously!
- **Native notification support** for all of the platforms. Clicking the notification opens that specific chat!
- **Online Indicator**: Shows an indicator at the bottom-left corner of the chats that are online!
- **Dark mode** for when you need to chill out your eyes in the night (or even in the day)
- **Custom Theme Support**: Write your own CSS theme for WhatsApp or use the in-built Theme Customizer to create a new one just by picking colors!
- **Available for most desktop platforms** including Windows (7 or above), Linux and MacOS.
- **Tray icon** so you can minimize the app completely and still receive notifications.
